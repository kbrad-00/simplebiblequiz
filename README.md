# BibleQuest: A Scriptural Trivia Challenge

## Project Purpose

Hi, I'm Bradley, and I created this project for my final Python assignment — but it's more than just a class project.

As a Christian and someone who enjoys trivia games, I wanted to combine both passions to create something fun and faith-centered. BibleQuest is a simple, text-based Bible quiz game that anyone can play to test their scriptural knowledge and grow in their understanding of the Word.
